# About this app

Polish football league Ekstraklasa is the top league in Poland. There is plenty of websites that provide statistics about football however there is lack of good visualisation for statistics of clubs and footballers. Even there is lack of good analysis.
In this analysis there is data visualisation using plotly - python graphing library and matplotlib.
